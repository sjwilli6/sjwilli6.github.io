This course has allowed me to grow my skills in R significantly. I feel more confident using R for other classes and in my career going forward. I have learned new methods to analyze data, visualizations, and different types of documents. I am probably the most confident right now in R over other software programs, so I do plan on using everything I learned in this class in the future.

I plan to use what I have learned in this class in my future career. I am able to create new visuals and documents that can help me prepare for presentations and client meetings. I also plan to use the different models and methods on future data that comes across my desk at work.

I plan to explore the area of biostatistics or clinical research. Living so close to RTP, there are plenty of companies looking for statisticians. I am open to different areas of interest as I am getting closer to graduating (December). This class has made me more confident in having R software as one of my strengths in my resume.
