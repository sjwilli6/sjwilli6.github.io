What do you think being a data scientist is about?  What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?
What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

A data scientist is someone who processes and analyzes large data sets to create a model with the best accuracy. Using software, data scientists are able
to test different models and create visualizations. A data scientist has to have previous knowledge in statistics and machine learning for data transformation,
exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and to make conclusions. Statisticians and data scientists gather and process data for similar
purposes. The biggest difference that I have noticed between the two are that data scientists select their model based on the accuracy of the data gathered.
Statisticians use simple models and consider the assumptions of the data/model, such as a linear regression model. I personally think that I overlap in the two
areas. Through coursework and my job, I believe that I tend to fall a little closer to a statistician. I have been taught that we need to make assumptions about
our data such as prior distributions, posterior distributions, etc.
