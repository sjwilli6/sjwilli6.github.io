# Financial Data API

### What did I Accomplish
I created a vignette for [Financial Data](https://polygon.io/docs/stocks) that will allow a user to call a specific function to return the correct data frame. Users can input a specific stock and recieve data from two specific date endpoints. They can also find information such as details about the stock, recent splits and dividends, and different CDs. I also created numeric summaries for stocks on January 9th and March 9th of 2023. Along with the numeric summaries, I created plots for numerous amounts of data points.

### Interesting Findings
I knew that Tesla was a popular stock and an upcoming company, but I did not realize how much the public and businesses were interacting with the stock. TSLA had an enormous amount of transactions and volume compared to the rest of the stocks in the stockmarket. Another thing that I found interesting is that the median stock in this database is roughly arround 20 dollars. I would have expected it to actually be less because of the magnitude of penny stocks. 

### Difficulties
I had my fair share of coding difficulties during this project. I first had to research different types of vignettes to determine exactly what I wanted. I also had to utilitize the `structure` function more times than I would have liked to ensure I was collecting the correct variables in my functions. I enjoyed working with the API, but most of the data that I found interesting needed a paid subscription or was too big to load. For example, i wanted to find data from all dates that allowed the user to be more specific. However, the API did not allow me to connect to a url that contained this data. As a result, I chose to pick data from two different dates, January 9th and March 9th.

If I were to do this differently in the future, I think that I would pick a different API. Although I am interested in the stock market and enjoy looking at trends/patterns, there was not a whole lot of numerical data that was free to obtain through my subscription. I would have thought this API would have had more numerical data that I would manipulate, but a lot of the URL's given were for specific stocks. I did not want data to a specific stock, because i wanted to look at the stock market as a whole.

I enjoyed doing this project and it allowed me to do certain things I have never done before. This project has made  me more confident using R and Github.
