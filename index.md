# Intro
I was born and raised in Raleigh, NC. I went to undergrad at NCSU. I am expected to graduate with my Master's Degree in Statistics this December. I currently work for a clinical research company in Durham, NC. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge in R this semester for ST558. I will beusing Github to blog about my projects and homeworks for ST558.

# Contact Info
I can be reached at sjwilli6@ncsu.edu. I am available to collaborate on most weekdays after 5 pm, or weekends with an advanced notice.

## Fun Facts About Me
I am an avid sports fan. I enjoy watching all of baseball, football, basketball, and hockey. Lately, I have been watching the **Carolina Hurricane's** run in the NHL playoffs.
