# Intro
I was born and raised in Raleigh, NC. I went to undergrad at NCSU. I am expected to graduate with my Master's Degree in Statistics this December. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge in R this semester for ST558.

# Contact Info
I can be reached at sjwilli6@ncsu.edu. I am available to collaborate on most weekdays after 5 pm, or weekends with an advanced notice.

Or maybe what you plan to blog about.
