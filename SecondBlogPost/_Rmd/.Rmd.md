## Thoughts on R

I have used a couple different software programs in my career and at NCSU. I have used SAS, R, JMP, and Prism. I enjoy using R as my software, because there are plenty of resources online to help with my coding if I get stuck. I enjoy the different functions and collection of libraries that are available with R. I have never used GitHub before, so I am looking forward to working with GitHub and R collectively. Since I use JMP and Prism almost every day in my work, I know the ins and outs of these software. Sometimes with R, I find myself having to search online in order to resolve my code which can take some time. I believe that having previous SAS experience in undergrad and other grad classes has helped me with learning R. Having any software experience helps understand what we are trying to code.
